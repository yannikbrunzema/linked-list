A linked list implementation for generic data in C.

Note: This implementation expects that any data supplied is allocated on the heap. If you utilise pointers that are stack allocated and you exit scope this WILL lead to undefined behavior.

Build instructions: 

gcc -o linked-list main.c linked-list.c

./linked-list
